  <p><a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/"><strong>Previously:</strong></a> A system-on-chip (SoC) combines the core functionality of a system—processing, graphics, memory, and control—into a single chip package.</p>
<p>I am eager to dig into the meat of the A14 and M1! But first I must set up a story.</p>
<h2>The hUMA race</h2>
<p>Circa 2015 (actually even a couple of years before that), the industry suddenly seemed to wake up and realise that graphics cards could do a lot more than just play video games. The nature of how they work (<a href="/issue121.html">Issue 121</a>) &amp; <a href="/issue122.html">122</a>)) makes them very amenable to solving problems in scientific computing, particularly in simulations, which use up computational resources by the petaflop, and energy by the megawatt.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the problem the industry now faces is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The GPU is massively powerful ... at doing a small subset of things. You can solve scientific equations but can’t run a computer with <em>only</em> a GPU.</li>
<li>The CPU is nimble, and much more suited for everyday tasks, like starting up a computer and connecting to multiple peripherals, and basically creating a useable digital environment for humans.</li>
<li>It thus makes the best sense to use the CPU to set up the heavy-lifting for the GPU, and have the GPU return the results after computation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember this diagram from <a href="/issue134.html">Issue 134</a>)?</p>
<p><img alt="Chipset diagram of ATX systems for Intel Core (i-Series)" src="/issue134_02.gif"></p>
<p>Think about how information would flow here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CPU requests data from the hard disks, which get put <em>into system memory</em> (DDR; left-most side).</li>
<li>It carries out some pre-processing on that data to set up the task for the GPU, reading from memory, and storing the results back in memory.</li>
<li>The data is <strong>copied</strong> <em>from system memory</em> to the GPU, which stores that data <em>in GPU memory</em> (GDDR; right-most side).</li>
<li>The GPU carries out the task, storing the results <em>in GPU memory</em>.</li>
<li>The CPU requests the data from GPU memory, <strong>copying</strong> it back <em>into system memory</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are you seeing lots of wasted effort there? I bolded it in case you missed it. So much copying of information!</p>
<p>The high-performance computer industry quickly realised that it could be much more efficient if the CPU and GPU could <em>share the same memory</em>.</p>
<p>The information flow in this hypothetical memory-sharing system would be simplified to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CPU requests data from the hard disks, which get put <em>into shared memory</em>.</li>
<li>The CPU pre-processes the data, storing it back into shared memory.</li>
<li>The CPU sends <em>the location</em> of the data to the GPU, which then reads <em>from shared memory</em> and carries out the task, storing the results back <em>into shared memory</em></li>
<li>The CPU retrieves the results directly <em>from shared memory</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We save time, bandwidth, and resources without having to copy data between CPU and GPU, twice! The only drawback is that with so many components (CPU, GPU, and others) accessing memory at the same time, you are going to need memory with really high bandwidth.</p>
<p>The industry gave this dream a name. They called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_System_Architecture">heterogeneous system architecture (HSA)</a>, using a heterogeneous unified memory architecture (hUMA) i.e. shared memory.</p>
<p><img alt="Unified memory diagram from Nvidia" src="/issue139_01.jpg"><br>
<em>Nvidia’s heterogeneous unified memory architecture (HUMA) dream<br />Source: <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-amd-nvidia-future-industry-hsa/2/">WCCFtech</a></em>    </p>
<p>It turns out that this is a pretty difficult task—consider the amount of bandwidth needed to support CPU <em>and</em> GPU access. Today no product from any company (besides Apple) fully implements this in its SoCs (<a href="/issue138.html">Issue 138</a>)) yet.</p>
<p><strong>Issue summary:</strong> Around 2015, the high-performance computer industry quickly realised that this would be much more efficient if the CPU and GPU could <em>share the same memory</em>.</p>
<p>I should stop here with this issue, and summarise the struggles of these companies in the next issue. They will make Apple’s success with the A14 &amp; M1 a much more compelling read :)</p>
<h2>What I’ll be covering next</h2>
<p><strong>Next issue:</strong> [LMG S10] Issue 140: The shared memory dream</p>
<p><strong>Sometime in the future:</strong> What is:</p>
<ul>
<li>XSS? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>a good reason developers write code and give it away for free online? [Issue 21]</li>
<li>OpenType? And what are fonts anyway? [Issue 42]</li>
</ul>
