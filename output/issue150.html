  <p><a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/"><strong>Previously:</strong></a> Containers are one layer of virtualisation above virtual machines: containerisation systems virtualise access to the operating system, presenting a virtual interface that provides software with the resources it needs, without being aware of software running in other containers on the same system.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>If I need to configure an entire machine to install and configure my own operating system (OS), I can rent a virtual machine — this is system virtualisation.</p>
<p>If I just need to run a set of software <em>on a particular OS</em> but don’t want the hassle of managing the rest of the OS, I can containerise them for the OS — this is containerisation.</p>
<p>What if I want to write software that will work the same on multiple OSes? Is that possible?</p>
<p>Before 1995, no!</p>
<h2>OS-level details are tricky</h2>
<p>OSes mediate access to resources through libraries (<a href="/issue017.html">Issue 17</a>)). Instead of having to deal with storage disk sectors and blocks, you can just use library features to ask the OS to help you create a file and write data to it. The OS and filesystem (<a href="/issue106.html">Issue 106</a>)) take care of the details.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to explain this more clearly without showing some programming code; the OS controls a lot of things! Which is a problem when it comes to multi-OS support, because different OSes control different things differently.</p>
<p>The library features for lots of things — storage, searching through directories, networking, etc — are different between Windows, Linux, MacOS, ...</p>
<h2>Abstracting away the details</h2>
<p>Can’t we program in a higher-level language, and use another program (the code interpreter) to break it down to different types of operations on different operating systems? E.g. <code>python.exe</code> on Windows will try to make my Python code work in Windows by using Windows libraries, <code>python</code> on Linux will do so using Linux libraries, and <code>python</code> on MacOS will do so using macOS libraries. Javascript, Ruby, Perl, VBScript, and other <strong>interpreted programming languages</strong> work this way too<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To a large extent, this is possible. But there remain some irreconcilable differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you need to use Python to run a command-line program, such as a shell script (<a href="/issue016.html">Issue 16</a>)), those will depend on terminal availability: not all terminals have cross-OS support!</li>
<li>If you need to specify a file location, Windows and Linux do not use the same path separators (the character that separates folder names in a folder hierarchy); Windows uses <code>\</code> to separate directory names, while Linux and MacOS uses <code>/</code>. This is often a source of bugs and headaches.</li>
<li>Important advanced features, such as multiprocessing (on multiple CPU cores simultaneously), are <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2010/python-multiprocessing-linux-windows/">handled differently in different OSes</a> in ways that may be incompatible within the same program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Virtualising processes vs virtualising hardware</h2>
<p>So it looks like we need something more. We need a programming language that can be interpreted into intermediate instructions (these are called <em>bytecode</em>), and we need a program for each OS that can carry out these intermediate instructions.</p>
<p>That program is also called a virtual machine (VM), but this is not hardware virtualisation. It is <em>process</em> virtualisation.</p>
<p>The OS interacts with virtual hardware without directly accessing the underlying hardware. Similarly, we want our code to interact with a virtual process instead of using OS libraries directly.</p>
<p>This is how the Java programming language works. It provides a (process) VM, called the Java VM, for each operating system. Your Java program interacts with the Java VM only; it mediates all access to the operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Issue summary:</strong> System VMs provide a set of virtualised hardware that the OS interacts with. Process VMs provide a set of libraries that a program (written in that programming language) interacts with.</p>
<h2>What I’ll be covering next</h2>
<p><strong>Next issue:</strong> [LMG S12] Issue 151: the Java VM</p>
<p>The idea sounds pretty cool ... so why don’t we write more programs this way? And what <em>is</em> the Java VM anyway?</p>
<p>Light discussion on code-adjacent issues next issue!</p>
<p><strong>Sometime in the future:</strong> What is:</p>
<ul>
<li>XSS? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>a good reason developers write code and give it away for free online? [Issue 21]</li>
<li>OpenType? And what are fonts anyway? [Issue 42]</li>
