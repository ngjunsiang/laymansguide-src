                <section><p>CPUs have limited throughput, since there is a max frequency they can operate at, and a limit to the number of wires they can be connected to (throughput = no. of wires × frequency). Later designs of early computers increased the capability of computers by delegating more work to secondary chips.</p></section>

                <section><p>The ATX form factor also brought with it a new breed of computers with more specialised chipsets: the memory controller hub (MCH) and peripheral controller hub (PCH). The MCH coordinates high-throughput components, such as computer memory and graphics. The PCH specialises in lower-throughput needs.</p></section>

                <section><p>Light takes 0.3 ns to travel 10 cm, approximately the distance by wire between the CPU and the MCH. This potentially causes operations between the CPU and MCH to slow down by one cycle, at frequencies above 3 GHz. One way the Intel Core i-series resolves this conundrum is to move the memory controller <em>into</em> the CPU.</p></section>

                <section><p>A modern CPU is manufactured through a process called photolithography, by which the CPU components are etched onto the silicon substrate by successive layers of chemicals, masking, and laser exposure. When the CPU components could be made small enough, the MCH and CPU were designed onto the same chip, and this is the design used by the Intel Core i7 (1st-gen).</p></section>

                <section><p>Slim laptops have been undergoing a gradual transition: more and more of their chips are no longer available as a replaceable card, but instead soldered directly to the mainboard. Since 2017/2018, most slim laptops pretty much have CPU, memory, storage, and network chips all soldered directly to the mainboard.</p></section>

                <section><p>The Apple A14 and Apple M1 are essentially the same chip architecture: they use almost the same building blocks, just with different numbers of them. On top of that, the Apple M1 implements unified memory, allowing the CPU and GPU (and other SoC components) to share the same system memory, greatly facilitating intra-chip communication.</p></section>
