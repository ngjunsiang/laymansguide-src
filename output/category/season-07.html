                <section><p>Comma-separated value (CSV) files store all data in text form. Within each row, a separator divides each chunk of data, and rows are separated by a line delimiter. To keep the data compact and read it more quickly, we have to decide beforehand what <em>data type</em> each chunk should be, and how much space it is allowed to take up. Such a data form can no longer be opened in a simple text editor program like Notepad.</p></section>

                <section><p>An index is a separate table containing key terms in the database (usually names, IDs, or some other key identifier), alongside the row numbers where they are found. An index greatly speeds up row lookups, but slows down the writing of new rows.</p></section>

                <section><p>Putting all data into one table results in unnecessary duplication of data. Making data atomic by splitting it up into multiple tables makes the data easier to work with, but requires multiple lookups and joins to get the required data. A standard database language, SQL, makes it possible to write queries that are supported by multiple databases.</p></section>

                <section><p>A database system follows rules that enable multiple users to send commands to the database at the same time. The system attempts to execute each action one at a time, locking data that is in use by other users, and ensuring that each user does not carry out actions that they are not permitted to. Such systems are better able to prevent data corruption compared to a text-based system.</p></section>

It has keywords and keyphrases that let you filter rows and columns, group and order data, perform basic arithmetic on data, and more. It is complex and powerful, but using it in an astute and efficient manner requires specialised training.</p></section>

                <section><p>Relational databases are designed to maintain a well-structured set of data tables through constraint rules. This makes them very useful for preventing accidental inconsistencies in data, but make any changes to the data schema difficult to implement. Changing from one schema to another involves downtime and a migration.</p></section>

                <section><p>Document databases organise data into documents, each containing a number of field-value pairs. Each value can itself be a document, and multiple values/documents can be grouped under a field. Document databases do not enforce data consistency across documents, so those rules need to be managed by the application which is using the database. This allows document databases to continue operating even when partitioned, at the cost of some consistency.</p></section>
