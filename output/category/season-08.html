                <section><p>Sandboxing is a catch-all term for the concept of ensuring apps don’t have access to resources outside of their privileges. Sandboxed apps are generally safer than non-sandboxed apps in terms of security, and easier to manage, terminate, and uninstall.</p></section>

                <section><p>Web apps have limited access to the device’ storage, and can only store data in browser-managed databases. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) can additionally register service workers that run in the background. Because they are so cleanly sandboxed, they can be easily removed by clearing the browser cache and storage, and deregistering any service workers manually.</p></section>

                <section><p>Web apps require the browser to request memory on their behalf, and thus their memory usage shows up under the browser process in the OS Task Manager. Web apps use this data to store a more convenient (but larger) representation of the webpage document, and to store the data needed by the app.</p></section>
