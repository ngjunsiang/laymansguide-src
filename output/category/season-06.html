                <section><p>DoubleClick, the first commercially successful ad server, launched in 1996. It ran a system that tracked the performance of banner ads across 30 sites, working to optimise their return on investment. This was made possible by standardisation of the web (thanks to the HTTP specification), and the birth of Javascript, a scripting language integrated into the webpage rather than being a separate module from it. All of this happened in 1995–1996.</p></section>

                <section><p>Advertising was sold on a CPM model (cost per thousand impressions) in the early Internet, until the dot-com bust forced companies to reconsider their ad-buying strategy. The CPC model (cost per click) became more popular, but was still not very user-targeted. It would take QuantCast, founded in 2006, to figure out a way to gather data on users and build a coherent profile of each demographic.</p></section>

                <section><p>By not enforcing strict cookie policies on their own sites, publishers allowed advertisers to sneakily set cookies on their site audience. This allowed advertisers to reach the same audience via their advertising slots on other websites, which could be bought more cheaply. The publishers were cut out of the value chain and were no longer “gatekeepers” to their own site readers. They could not sell their advertising slots at a premium.</p></section>
