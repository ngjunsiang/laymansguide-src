                <section><p>Developers can specialise in frontend, backend, or full-stack development. They write applications for more purposes than I can really count. Not all code is written for an application; some code is written for specialised purposes. And code can be written at different levels of abstraction. High-level code is easier to understand and write because it hides the details of how a computer operates, while low-level code is detailed and able to squeeze the most performance from a computer, but difficult to understand and write.</p></section>

                <section><p>A command line is a way of giving commands to the computer in the form of text. An instruction consists of the name of the program to be run, and the options that it needs to use. Command lines provide a fallback mechanism when graphical interfaces break down, and are a much more remote-friendly interface.</p></section>

                <section><p>Everybody has a simpleton in their pocket, and maybe one at home on the desk. These simpletons are able to run sets of instructions that they are carrying. You can give them more sets of instructions, often obtained through a Store. Some of the really good instruction sets will cost some money, though. And almost none of them will get the simpleton to do exactly what you want.</p></section>

                <section><p>n git, forking a repository creates a copy of it for you to work on. Merging a repository with the original combines the commits from both so that they become one repository again. Conflicts arising from commits from both codepaths that affect the same part of the code will need to be resolved manually. Developers do most of this forking and merging in Github, an online platform for working on and talking about code.</p></section>

Your devices work because they follow specifications.</p></section>

But often, the more popular way is to publish the app to a repository (also known as an app store, for mobile devices). Before this can be done, the code or application needs to be packaged according to the requirements of the repository.</p></section>
