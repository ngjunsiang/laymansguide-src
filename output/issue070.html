  <p><a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/"><strong>Previously:</strong></a> Cookies are little fragments of information with a name and a value, and associated with a domain address. They are most commonly used to identify new or returning users. This cookie is issued by a website upon the first visit, stored in the browser, and returned to the issuing server whenever the server requests it.</p>
<p>This issue is a short one, just to put one more piece in place. Last issue, I said that <code>analytics.js</code> loaded a <code>_gid</code> cookie with a value of <code>GA1.2.1807773255.1584140066</code>. At that point, the cookie only existed in my web browser. How did it get sent back to Google Analytics for counting?</p>
<p>Let’s watch what is happening with Google DevTools:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of DevTools in Vivaldi browser, with a request by analytics.js highlighted." src="/issue070_01.png"><br /><small>Chrome DevTools showing the (filtered) sequence of requests made by the webpage I loaded.<br />
The request made by <code>analytics.js</code> (third-last line) is highlighted in gray. The Initiator column tells us this requested was initiated by <code>analytics.js</code> on line 25 of the script.</small></p>
<p>The full URL of the highlighted request is <code>http://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&amp;_v=j81&amp;a=227860763&amp;t=pageview&amp;_s=1&amp;dl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adopsinsider.com%2Fad-serving%2Fhow-does-ad-serving-work%2F&amp;ul=en-us&amp;de=UTF-8&amp;dt=How%20Ad%20Serving%20Works&amp;sd=24-bit&amp;sr=3840x2160&amp;vp=1319x1284&amp;je=0&amp;_u=QACAAAAB~&amp;jid=&amp;gjid=&amp;cid=184706471.1584140066&amp;tid=UA-13115681-1&amp;_gid=1807773255.1584140066&amp;gtm=2wg340NLT927&amp;z=1600454420.</code></p>
<p>That’s unreadable for humans!</p>
<p>In layman terms, <code>analytics.js</code> sends a request to http://www.google-analytics.com (yup, unsecured transmission since it does not use HTTPS) with the following information:</p>

<p>See anything interesting there? Here, let me highlight it for you:</p>
<p><code>_gid: 1807773255.1584140066</code></p>
<p>Yup, <code>analytics.js</code> sets a cookie if there isn’t one, or retrieves the existing cookie if there is one. It sends the cookie back to <code>google-analytics.com</code> with your cookie ID, so Google Analytics knows who is visiting the page and can count visitor stats for the webpage.</p>
<p>It makes sense for a webpage to embed <code>analytics.js</code> so that Google Analytics can help it count page visits. But why would a webpage allow Facebook and other ad services to put their cookies on a reader’s browser and then send it back to their own servers? Doesn’t that worsen the site experience? What is the benefit to them?</p>
<p>That is the key insight that Quantcast arrived at.</p>
<p><strong>Issue summary:</strong> When browsing a webpage, a tracking script retrieves the browser's existing cookie, if there is one, or sets a cookie for the browser if there isn’t one. The tracking script sends the cookie information back to the originating server, along with many other fragments of information.</p>
<p>Short issue just to close the loop on cookie setting and returning. Enjoy the mental break! :)</p>
<h2>What I’ll be covering next</h2>
<p><strong>Next issue:</strong> [LMG S6] Issue 71: The Rise of Audience Analytics</p>
<p>When it comes to ad networks, there is the How aspect, and the Why aspect. The How aspect is almost hopelessly complicated, an ever-evolving race of advertisers vs ad-blockers, each trying to outdo the other. I will focus less on this aspect, and more on the Why aspect. I think it is more critical to understanding what information advertisers actually extract, and why it does not make any sense for them to want to know your personal details.</p>
<p><strong>Sometime in the future:</strong> What is:</p>
<ul>
<li>booting up? [Issue 15]</li>
<li>XSS? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>a CDN? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>a good reason developers write code and give it away for free online? [Issue 21]</li>
<li>firmware? [Issue 34]</li>
<li>OpenType? And what are fonts anyway? [Issue 42]</li>
<li>What is involved in installing a piece of software? [Issue 48]</li>
<li>How do apps know where a file starts and ends? [Issue 49]</li>
