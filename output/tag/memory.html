                <section><p>The CPU stores data for ready access in the CPU cache. Accessing data from the CPU cache is much faster than accessing data from memory. When the CPU needs data from a memory address, it looks in the cache first. If the data is not there (a <strong>cache miss</strong>), it will load the data from the memory address, and store a copy in the cache for faster reference in future. The CPU cache is managed by the CPU and is invisible to the OS. Programs that need to ensure the data in the cache is “fresh” can perform a cache flush and reload.</p></section>

These cores are organised into compute units; a graphics card with more compute units can perform more calculations every second. Graphics cards have their own onboard memory, separate from the CPU. GPU memory is different from computer memory; it is configured for much higher data throughput. Integrated graphics are GPUs that are integrated into a CPU chip; these do not have their own onboard memory, and share memory with the CPU.</p></section>
