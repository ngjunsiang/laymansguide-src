                <section><p>Developers can specialise in frontend, backend, or full-stack development. They write applications for more purposes than I can really count. Not all code is written for an application; some code is written for specialised purposes. And code can be written at different levels of abstraction. High-level code is easier to understand and write because it hides the details of how a computer operates, while low-level code is detailed and able to squeeze the most performance from a computer, but difficult to understand and write.</p></section>

But often, the more popular way is to publish the app to a repository (also known as an app store, for mobile devices). Before this can be done, the code or application needs to be packaged according to the requirements of the repository.</p></section>

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) can additionally register service workers that run in the background. Because they are so cleanly sandboxed, they can be easily removed by clearing the browser cache and storage, and deregistering any service workers manually.</p></section>
