  <p>Just thinking about recreating the Readmill reading experience in an app was mind-boggling, especially for someone like me with minimal programming experience. I decided to poke around looking for ideas, projects, things I could hop on to.</p>
<p>As a way to have highlight permalinks, <a href="https://hypothes.is/about">Hypothes.is</a> looks really promising. I can link people to highlights I have made, and they can reply inline, and the whole conversation can be referenced via a convenient URL (<a href="https://hypothes.is/a/8jaysPv0QFuycAmGgdqTgQ">such as this</a>). It even appears in context if you <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/">load the Hypothes.is extension</a> while on the page.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a highlight on the Hypothes.is website" src="/issue002_01.png"><br>
<em>One of my highlights in Hypothes.is. It has its own permalink!</em>    </p>
<p>The best part? I already have an account, and quite a few highlights in there for use. No need to write the whole annotation system myself! Now I just need to figure out how to get my annotations from there, and put new annotations into the Hypothes.is service.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of profile page from the Hypothes.is website" src="/issue002_02.png"><br>
<em>My Hypothes.is profile and annotations</em>    </p>
<p>First, I will need to figure out how to read and write the data from the website, and how to interpret it.</p>
<p>Next issue: Reading and writing web data-what is all this clutter?</p>
