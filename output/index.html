                <section><p>Developers can specialise in frontend, backend, or full-stack development. They write applications for more purposes than I can really count. Not all code is written for an application; some code is written for specialised purposes. And code can be written at different levels of abstraction. High-level code is easier to understand and write because it hides the details of how a computer operates, while low-level code is detailed and able to squeeze the most performance from a computer, but difficult to understand and write.</p></section>

Merging a repository with the original combines the commits from both so that they become one repository again. Conflicts arising from commits from both codepaths that affect the same part of the code will need to be resolved manually.

                <section><p>An image’s resolution describes its dimensions. Its pixel resolution gives an indication of its physical size (if printed or displayed on a screen), and thus its sharpness. A display with imperceptibly small pixels is often referred to as a Retina display (Apple’s branding) or as a high-PPI display; this requires at least 220 PPI nominally. For an image to be printed sharply, it needs at least 300 DPI.</p></section>

                <section><p>Humans can distinguish 120 dB of loudness, which means the loudest perceivable sound is a million times louder than the softest perceivable sound. CD audio provides 16 bits of information per sample, sufficient to provide 96 dB. Humans have a hearing range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. CD audio is sampled at 44.1 kHz. Uncompressed audio thus requires 705,600 bits per second, or 86 KiB/s.</p></section>

                <section><p>Computers compress image and audio data through a process similar to summarising: it analyses the data using algorithms that use brightness and colour instead of RGB values for images, and different frequencies of sound rather than samples at different points in time for audio. These algorithms then discard parts of the information that human senses do not perceive easily, and reduce the resolution of other parts that human senses are not as sensitive to.</p></section>

                <section><p>Meltdown and Spectre require the programs executing them to have access to kernel memory space. Kernel address isolation attempts to prevent the program from even having access to the kernel address space in the first place. TLB flushing changes the virtual-to-physical memory mapping, disrupting Spectre’s reliance on a consistent virtual-to-physical memory mapping.</p></section>

Each value can itself be a document, and multiple values/documents can be grouped under a field. Document databases do not enforce data consistency across documents, so those rules need to be managed by the application which is using the database. This allows document databases to continue operating even when partitioned, at the cost of some consistency.</p></section>

                <section><p>USB Power Delivery is a specification that describes how much voltage and current can be supplied by different categories of USB cables. It allows power delivery at different levels for all kinds of connected devices, up to 100W. This should help to simplify cable setups that otherwise require multiple kinds of cables between two closely interconnected devices (such as a laptop and an external monitor).</p></section>

                <section><p>The larger the surface area, the faster an object loses heat. The larger the temperature difference between object and surroundings, the faster the object loses heat. Heat is bad for computers, and CPUs will need cooling to be able to process computations quickly. A mobile phone thus typically uses no more than 4 W of power, a laptop can use 25–45 W, and a desktop can usually use 65 W and more. Two popular ways of increasing the cooling capacity of a device is to attach a larger piece of metal to the chip (passive cooling), or use a fan to force air over the heatsink (active cooling).</p></section>
