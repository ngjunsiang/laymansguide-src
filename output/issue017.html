  <p>Welcome back! Last issue must have been exhausting to read, and I want this issue to be more readily digestible. So there’re only going to be two examples. Promise.</p>
<p>A shell script works really well when you just need to do things with folders, and run programs to work on files. But anything more advanced, such as <a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/a6941efd-86bf-4fd8-92c9-009fe14a8c2a">making network requests</a>, quickly gets tricky. Usually this is where the programmers start to whip out their favourite programming language. But …</p>
<h2>Low-level Sockets vs High-level Requests</h2>
<p>In python, crafting an HTTP request from scratch looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">socket</span>

<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">socket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">socket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">AF_INET</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">socket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SOCK_STREAM</span><span class="p">)</span>                 
<span class="n">s</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s2">&quot;www.hypothes.is&quot;</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">80</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">s</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sendall</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;GET /api/annotations/GqDxiuhpEeiMa6f5UN7ttA HTTP/1.1</span><span class="se">\r\n\r\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4096</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">s</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>5 lines of code every time I want to get an annotation from Hypothes.is? That’s going to add up fast … I could wrap that code up into a function, and then it would be easier to just call that function in one line instead of 5.</p>
<p>Carry that thought to its logical conclusion, and you get a library.</p>
<p>Creating an HTTP request with the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">Requests library</a> be like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>

<span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://www.hypothes.is/api/annotations/GqDxiuhpEeiMa6f5UN7ttA&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A good library makes complicated things simpler, so you can focus on what you need to do.</p>
<h2>There’s a library for it</h2>
<p>Apple’s App Store slogan, “There’s an app for that”, is so famous that <a href="https://trademark.trademarkia.com/theres-an-app-for-that-77980556.html">they actually trademarked it</a>. So it is with programmers. For almost everything you want to do in the most commonly used programming languages, someone has created a library for it. If they haven’t, then it’s up to you to make one.</p>
<p>But sometimes, some projects are just way beyond your current level of knowledge. If you wanted to dabble in advanced machine learning(i.e. AI), one option is to go for a PhD … or tinker with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Google’s TensorFlow platform</a>.</p>
<p>How do you do that in Python? You need the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install">TensorFlow Python library</a>. And then you probably <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials">need some tutorials</a> to get started.</p>
<p>If there isn’t a library available … you might as well get started on that PhD.</p>
<p>But TensorFlow only comes with a Python library. What if you don’t use Python, but use Ruby instead? Then your best hope is to petition Google for a Ruby library, or <a href="https://medium.com/@Arafat./introducing-tensorflow-ruby-api-e77a477ff16e">hope someone else ports it for you</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s plain to see that without these advanced libraries, it would take much longer to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Issue summary:</strong> Libraries make it easier to do the same thing in a programming language, or enable advanced functionality that wasn’t available previously. Libraries are usually specific to a particular programming language, and can’t be used in another programming language.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, so it turned out I only wrote one example, and linked extensively to another one. This didn’t need to be complicated, and aside from the code I hope I didn’t lose you. Was this issue too difficult to grasp, or am I moving too fast? Drop me an email, I can adjust :)</p>
<h2>What I’ll be covering next</h2>
<p><strong>Next issue:</strong> Frameworks</p>
<p><strong>Sometime in the future:</strong> What is:</p>
<ul>
<li>booting up? [Issue 15]</li>
<li>a specification? [Issue 6,8]</li>
<li>a cookie? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>a cache? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>XSS? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>a CDN? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>Unicode? And what does it have to do with emoji? [Issue 8]</li>
<li>What are those '\r\n's in the HTTP request packet [Issue 12,17]?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep, if you’re sharp-eyed you might have noticed the '\r\n's in the socket example ;) All in good time.</p>
