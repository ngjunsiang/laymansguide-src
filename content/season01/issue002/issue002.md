Just thinking about recreating the Readmill reading experience in an app was mind-boggling, especially for someone like me with minimal programming experience. I decided to poke around looking for ideas, projects, things I could hop on to.

As a way to have highlight permalinks, [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/about) looks really promising. I can link people to highlights I have made, and they can reply inline, and the whole conversation can be referenced via a convenient URL ([such as this](https://hypothes.is/a/8jaysPv0QFuycAmGgdqTgQ)). It even appears in context if you [load the Hypothes.is extension](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) while on the page.

*One of my highlights in Hypothes.is. It has its own permalink!*    

The best part? I already have an account, and quite a few highlights in there for use. No need to write the whole annotation system myself! Now I just need to figure out how to get my annotations from there, and put new annotations into the Hypothes.is service.

First, I will need to figure out how to read and write the data from the website, and how to interpret it.

Next issue: Reading and writing web data-what is all this clutter?
