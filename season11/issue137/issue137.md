[**Previously:**](https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/) Slim laptops have been undergoing a gradual transition: more and more of their chips are no longer available as a replaceable card, but instead soldered directly to the mainboard. Since 2017/2018, most slim laptops pretty much have CPU, memory, storage, and network chips all soldered directly to the mainboard.

Let’s get to it: Intel vs M1 Macbook Air!

## The M1 Macbook Air: all aboard

Here’s the Macbook Air in 2020. There was one in early 2020 using an Intel Core CPU, and one in late 2020  using the Apple M1 CPU.

The M1 not only performs better, it does so while passively cooled! From [Issue 129](https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s10-issue-129-cooling/), this suggests the M1 Macbook Air also uses less power (8–12W) for its tasks.

It looks like the M1 has “swallowed” a number of chips! There are fewer chips in the M1 Macbook Air, and the CPU is much larger. What does this mean?

## The Apple M1: evolved from a smartphone chip

To get into that story, I’ll have to go even more mobile, and look at smartphone CPUs. After all, the Apple M1 actually evolved from the Apple A-series CPUs for their iPhone and iPad. That starts next issue.

## What about other Intel Core laptops running Windows?

They are largely undergoing the same transition, just more slowly. This is the Microsoft Surface Laptop in 2017:

Larger-sized laptops that can afford the space may still have solid state storage on a separate card.

**Issue summary:** The M1 goes one step further: not only does it make do with fewer chips, it does so with passive cooling!

The last issue simply went on too long, especially with all the images, so I figured this issue would stand better as a Core-vs-M1 comparison, instead of being the tail of an evolution-of-Air issue. So it’s short.

## What I’ll be covering next

**Next issue:** [LMG S10] Issue 138: System-on-Chip (SoC)

If smartphones are even smaller than laptops, how do they do it? Laptops seem to have exhausted all the tricks, and those boards still look pretty big.

Next issue, I’ll talk about the next step in the evolution of shrinking mainboards.

**Sometime in the future:** What is:

- XSS? [Issue 8]
- a good reason developers write code and give it away for free online? [Issue 21]
- OpenType? And what are fonts anyway? [Issue 42]
