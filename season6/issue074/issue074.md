[**Previously:**](https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/) When a page loads advertisements through header bidding, it sends your cookie along with other information to an ad exchange. The ad exchange conducts automated bidding among the ad-buyers, determines the winner(s), and sends the winning code(s) back to your browser. Your browser then sends these codes to the **CDN**, which sends back the winning ads for your page to render in your browser.
