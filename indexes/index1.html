                            <p>It’s been a good one-month break, so I figured it’s a good time to post some new updates!</p>
<p>To new subscribers: hello! 👋 this newsletter was active on a weekly basis up until 23 April 2022, when I sent out the 13th issue of the 13th season. Up till this point, I had been structuring the content around themes, with each season covering each theme one concept at a time. From this point on, I will be posting on a much slower tempo, and no longer in seasons—that means more unstructured posts.</p>
<p>A recent spate of AI-related news, the most recent one being <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google+lambda+lemoine&amp;utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=status-update" target="_blank">Google engineer Blake Lemoine claiming LaMDA is sentient</a>, got me thinking that maybe AI has finally entered mainstream awareness. While we can’t exactly introspect the inner workings of a machine learning model, I don’t think that is an excuse for treating it as a black box. The explanations I’ve found from tech publications don’t explain what is actually going on in machine learning; time for a layman’s guide!</p>
<p>But I’m definitely out of my depth here, since this is not a topic I’ve had the chance to study even at an undergraduate level. Not that it’s going to stop me! I have been unpacking technical explanations beyond my depth for three years now, no reason to stop at machine learning and AI models.</p>

The most effective measure for improving device responsiveness is usually to clear the app cache, so the app does not attempt to read previous data from storage.</p>
<p>Last issue, we shed a little light on the mystery of why phone and laptop systems slow down over time—apparently the way a file database works is to blame?</p>
<p>This week, we switch topics, to look at something we definitely take for granted: search engines!</p>

<p>Last issue, I walked through common causes of system slowdown suggested by generic tech websites, and explained simple ways of checking if these are really the cause. Quite often, they are not, especially if you are the kind who is careful about internet usage and does regular system maintenance.</p>

The maintainers of distros maintain repositories of software that have been tested with the distro. Most users will access software in the distro’s repositories through a program called a package manager. So users have full control over when updates and new software should be installed.</p>
<p>Once your laptop hits the magical 1-year window, it somehow seems to … get slower. And slower. Everything takes just a fraction longer. What used to happen near-instantaneously now seems to take a split-second pause. The loading spinner animation feels like it plays just a little longer. And it just gets worse from there with age.</p>
<p>Google search results have a number of things to say about why it happens:</p>

<li>System updates</li>
<li>Software by the OS maker (first-party software)</li>
<li>Software from other developers (third-party software)</li>

<p>Brief recap of the past few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content distribution:</strong> Images and other media are distributed with the help of content distribution networks (CDNs, <a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s13-issue-160-cdns-and-content-distribution/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s13-issue-163-system-software-ecosystems" target="_blank">Issue 160</a>), which have regional servers closer to users.</li>
<li><strong>Code distribution:</strong> Webpage documents and web scripts (in Javascript) are distributed from the host server (which may comprise more than one computer).</li>
</ul>
<p>And all of these takes place over the World Wide Web, often through the HTTP protocol (<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-issue-7-what-is-http/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s13-issue-163-system-software-ecosystems" target="_blank">Issue 7</a>).

Today, websites are protected from loading unauthorised scripts through cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy implemented in browsers, which only allows a website to load scripts from authorised domains.</p>
<p>This is the issue that doesn’t really fit anywhere, but this season is about lots of things we take for granted and fonts are one of them.</p>
<p>I could probably fill at least half a season talking about fonts and typesetting, but let’s stick to the basics here.</p>

<p>All businessmen know that distribution is everything. How good your product is, is secondary to how you get your product to the customer. This act of getting things to your customer—it’s called distribution, and entire businesses have been built around excellent distribution.</p>
<p>In <a href="" target="_blank">Issue 157</a>, I described how time is synchronised from time source to server and on to other servers, down the strata of the hierarchy tree of time servers. whereas GPS/wifi location (<a href="" target="_blank">Issue 158</a>) has a much shallower distribution system: everybody gets their location directly from a GPS satellite if there’s nothing else available, otherwise they get it from the nearest wifi point or cell tower.</p>

<p>Ah, GPS. The only topic that actually has almost nothing to do with computing … and yet the mobile computers in our pocket rely on it so much.</p>
<h2>A short history</h2>
<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) was born of the space age, in 1973, before computers even went mainstream. It was originally used for military applications, particularly for navigation. It was first widely used in a political conflict in the Gulf War (1990–1991). The public finally had access to it in 1996, after US President Bill Clinton issued a policy directive for it to be dual-use (used for both military and civilian purposes).</p>

<h2>Global time information</h2>
<p>Frequent fliers would no doubt be familiar with the existence of timezones: geographical bands stretching from the North to South pole, within which all locations are assumed to be running on the same regional time. These timezones used to be manually synchronised, by phone or telegram, via operators all over the globe.</p>

<p>So, just-in-time (JIT) compilation is really cool and mostly works. Feed in enough instructions to fill a buffer, and execute them. Keep your fingers crossed and hope the buffer doesn’t empty. That’s kind of how our global supply chain works too.</p>
<p>But sometimes it doesn’t go smoothly. The program hits a code branch, new instructions have to be unpredictably injected. The emulation layer halts temporarily. The program stutters.</p>
<p>We can’t really avoid that, not without rewriting the program anyway. But we can at least decide <em>when</em> to carry out the translation.</p>

The JRE has to be installed on the user’s system for Java programs to work, unless the program bundles the supporting libraries. Solo programmers can start programming with OpenJDK for free with fewer features and less support, while commercial companies can license Oracle JDK for better support and features.</p>
<p>So you started taking up programming. Maybe you went to a class, where everything was set up for you and you didn’t have to worry about installing and configuring necessary software. Or you took an online course, where step-by-step instructions were provided and you mostly didn’t have to spend time scratching your head. That’s how it should be; you paid to learn <em>programming</em>, not to learn how to configure a software development environment.</p>
<p>Once you actually have to start writing code though …</p>

<p>If I need to configure an entire machine to install and configure my own operating system (OS), I can rent a virtual machine — this is system virtualisation.</p>
<p>If I just need to run a set of software <em>on a particular OS</em> but don’t want the hassle of managing the rest of the OS, I can containerise them for the OS — this is containerisation.</p>

<h2>Business concerns</h2>
<p>Every business computer you have encountered likely runs an operating system (OS). And yet, what value does managing the OS have for the business? They have business software to run—point-of-sale systems, accounting systems, communication systems e.g. email—but the OS is no big concern for them, as long as it runs the software!</p>
<p>If I have point-of-sale software that only runs in Windows, and I’m paying for a company to provide it as a service, I don’t care if the software actually runs on Windows with direct hardware access, or if it is doing it through a virtual machine, <em>so long as it works</em>.</p>

<h2>Co-located hosting</h2>
<p>A not-so-long time ago, to run a website, you literally just ran a webserver on your desktop, connected it to the internet, and gave your IP address to other people. This is a pretty unreliable way to host a business website though. A big company would make business arrangements to procure a reliable internet connection, set up the infrastructure (power, cooling, mounting hardware) required to run multiple computers, and then manage their multiple systems with a full IT management team (hardware &amp; software).</p>
<p>Not every company can afford this. Smaller companies would therefore <strong>co-locate</strong> their computers (called colo boxes) with bigger companies, enjoying service support and infrastructure for a monthly/yearly fee. Some companies decided to just provide these services as their full-time business, and the hosting business was born.</p>

If a bootup program enumerates hardware devices and receives a response, then as long as it continues to receive valid and correct responses, it can work with the virtual hardware to run an operating system.</p>
<p>So … what is it like to run an operating system (OS) on virtual hardware? I promised screenshots, but they probably won’t be as exciting as you expect—it looks quite normal!</p>
<h2>Creating a virtual machine</h2>
<p>I don’t want to purchase a VMware license, so I will be using an alternative virtual machine product instead: Oracle’s free Virtualbox. This is what it looks like, running on Arch Linux on my laptop:</p>

<p>How does one trick an operating system (OS) into coexisting with other operating systems on a single machine? By <em>virtualising</em> hardware into virtual drivers!</p>
<h2>Virtual network hardware</h2>
<p>Let’s take an example. Take a look at your network devices: there's one for your LAN port, there’s one for your wifi card, and these days there may be one each for your Bluetooth chip and 4G/5G modem too.</p>

<p>I want to circle back to talking about processors again in this season, because there are a couple of pretty world-shaking ideas I haven’t fully fleshed out in Layman’s Guide yet.</p>
<p>One of them is—hmm where do I begin. As early as 1641, in Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes proposes that “All that up to the present time I have accepted as most true and certain I have learned either from the senses or through the senses; but it is sometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive, and it is wiser not to trust entirely to anything by which we have once been deceived.” In other words, Descartes isn’t always sure that he believes what he sees; his senses sometimes deceive him about the nature of reality.</p>
<p>More than three centuries later, in 1999, the Wachowski brothers translate this idea into a more modern form: what if the world as we know it is a simulation running on some other cosmic, otherworldly hardware? Is it possible to signal to our senses so convincingly that a simulacrum may be thought of as real?</p>

On top of that, the Apple M1 implements unified memory, allowing the CPU and GPU (and other SoC components) to share the same system memory, greatly facilitating intra-chip communication.</p>
<p>So, before 2020: smartphones are smartphones, laptops are laptops. They use different types of CPUs with different architectures (<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s11-issue-141-the-apple-a14-and-m1/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-142-implications-part-1-software" target="_blank">Issue 141</a>) and even different instruction sets (<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s5-issue-53-the-cpu-is-an-instruction-obeying/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-142-implications-part-1-software" target="_blank">Issue 53</a>). Never the twain shall meet.</p>
<p>After 2020: It turns out that smartphone chips can be upgraded and used in laptops, while remaining essentially the same architecture? Its power consumption dial can be turned down to almost zero but also turned all the way up?</p>
<p>That opens up the possibility that smartphones and laptops can run on the same hardware, and there’s nothing technically stopping apps compiled (<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s5-issue-54-compiling-programming-code-into/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-142-implications-part-1-software" target="_blank">Issue 54</a>) for that instruction set to run on both!<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Circa 2009, changes were happening on the desktop motherboard, as the memory controller hub (MCH) came on-board the CPU to reduce latency when communicating with memory (<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s11-issue-134-part-1-the-intel-core-i-series/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-140-the-shared-memory-dream" target="_blank">Issues 134</a>–<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s11-issue-135-part-2-unifying-the-cpu-and-mch/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-140-the-shared-memory-dream" target="_blank">135</a>). But the memory chips themselves remained on the motherboard, and this was the case even in 2018, in Apple’s Macbook Air (<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s11-issue-136-the-mobile-workstation-laptops/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-140-the-shared-memory-dream" target="_blank">Issue 136</a>).</p>

<h2>The hUMA race</h2>
<p>Circa 2015 (actually even a couple of years before that), the industry suddenly seemed to wake up and realise that graphics cards could do a lot more than just play video games. The nature of how they work (<a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s10-issue-121-in-graphic-detail/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-139-whats-before-this-line-is-mine" target="_blank">Issue 121</a> &amp; <a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s10-issue-122-the-great-flattening/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s11-issue-139-whats-before-this-line-is-mine" target="_blank">122</a>) makes them very amenable to solving problems in scientific computing, particularly in simulations, which use up computational resources by the petaflop, and energy by the megawatt.</p>

The bigger components, like memory and storage, changed from being separate discrete parts to being another component soldered directly to the mainboard.</p>
<p>But that only gets us so far; even in the M1 Macbook Air, the mainboard is still almost the entire length of a phone. There’s got to be something else.</p>

<p>In the last 4 issues, I walked through the general evolution of desktop computers. Let’s go more mobile, and look at laptops. How does something as big as a desktop shrink down to the size of a laptop? And what are the tradeoffs involved?</p>

This potentially causes operations between the CPU and MCH to slow down by one cycle, at frequencies above 3 GHz. One way the Intel Core i-series resolves this conundrum is to move the MCH <em>into</em> the CPU.</p>

<p>Time to close up some open plot points from last issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of pins on 1st-gen Core i7 is almost triple that of the Pentium 4; what are all those pins for?</li>
<li>The MCH has been moved into the CPU to improve latencies, but how is it possible to make it small enough to do that?</li>
<li>Are there any disadvantages?</li>

The MCH specialises in high-throughput requirements, such as computer memory and graphics. The PCH specialises in lower-throughput needs.</p>
<p>Last issue, we looked at the ATX form factor by Intel, which replaced the AT form factor by IBM. While the AT could get by with a smattering of chips, which worked fine for mostly text-only computers, the ATX has much higher throughput requirements. To help the CPU focus on serving the user’s applications, two chipsets—the memory controller hub (MCH) and peripheral controller hub (PCH), take charge of managing the data throughput. The MCH manages data between CPU, computer memory, the graphics processor unit (GPU), and the PCH, while the PCH manages data between the peripherals (audio, storage, network, USB, ...) and the MCH.</p>

Later designs of early computers increased the capability of computers by delegating more work to secondary chips.</p>
<p>When computers began hitting the mainstream market, they were designed to be able to use interchangeable parts so as to reduce cost and inventory. To support this effort, manufacturers came up with standards for how to lay out computer components on a mainboard; the different patterns came to be known as <strong>form factors</strong>.</p>
<p>The AT form factor, by IBM, is one of the early ones. An AT motherboard looks something like this:</p>

All electronics are DC-only, and require an AC-DC adapter to be powered from the wall. The AC-DC conversion produces a significant amount of heat; AC-DC adapters are usually external unless the device has sufficient space or cooling capacity for it.</p>
<p>This season, let’s open up that computer case and see what’s inside. Where does everything fit, and how does all that information get around? More importantly, how are computers able to cover such a large range of sizes, from towering desktops to tiny smartphones?</p>
<h2>What a computer wants, what a computer needs</h2>
<p>The common model of a computer is that it … computes. It calculates. It takes in numbers, and spits out more numbers.</p>

The larger the temperature difference between an object and its surroundings, the faster the object loses heat. Heat is bad for computers, and CPUs will need cooling to be able to process computations quickly. A mobile phone thus typically uses no more than 4 W of power, a laptop can use 25–45 W, and a desktop can usually use 65 W and more. Two popular ways of increasing the cooling capacity of a device is to attach a larger piece of metal to the chip (passive cooling), or use a fan to force air over the heatsink (active cooling).</p>
<p><strong>Point 1:</strong> A powerful device produces lots of heat.<br/>
<strong>Point 2:</strong> A device that produces lots of heat needs a large surface area (directly in contact with the heat source) to stay (relatively) cool.</p>
<p>These are two of the primary factors determining how tiny a computer can be. Can something the size of an iPhone be as powerful as something the size of a Macbook? It depends on how much cooling is available to it!</p>
<p>One more factor to add in this issue: power. Without power, none of your devices would work … and that is one more source of heat to be dissipated, incidentally.</p>

Devices which were designed to be small and portable generally eliminate these as far as possible, opting to have parts directly soldered to the board instead.</p>
<p>Why do computers need power?</p>
<p>Other home appliances I can understand. They need to heat up air/water, move air/water around, or extract heat from air/water to move it elsewhere. These things all need energy. But a computer … all it does is move electrons around! All the information in a computer that changes is just electrons moving; that should not need so much power, should it?</p>
<p>As it turns out, energy-information equivalence theories posit that manipulating information does increase entropy which does involve energy—but this is the Layman’s Guide to Computing, not a physics newsletter. Let’s just say that managing information, in its abstract sense, needs very little energy.</p>

It allows power delivery at different levels for all kids of connected devices, up to 100W. This should help to simplify cable setups that otherwise require multiple kinds of cables between two closely interconnected devices (such as a laptop and an external monitor).</p>
<p>At some point in the past, computers could be upgraded with all kinds of parts: you could upgrade to a better network card, a better processor, or add more memory, without changing out the entire computer!</p>
<h2>The short history of personal computers</h2>
<p>After IBM released the IBM 360, the first mainframe that was meant to be used in both large-scale and small-scale applications, it quickly realised that providing service support for it was going to be a nightmare if each version required its own specialised support. In the 1970s, it was already thinking of a family-of-parts concept that allowed its products to use a set of interchangeable parts to reduce the number of these parts.</p>

USB Type-C is a new connector standard that supports USB 3, DisplayPort, HDMI, and Thunderbolt. It is able to carry multiple types of data simultaneously, in limited combinations. In a USB connection, one device acts as the host while the other acts as the device; the host initiates all communication.</p>
<p>Last week, I differentiated the USB Type-C  specification from the USB3  specification; the former describes how the cable and connector should be, while the latter describes how to transmit USB data over a Type-C cable. Remember that in addition to USB3 data, the Type-C cable can also transmit HDMI or DisplayPort video data!</p>

Analog signals need a digital-analog-conversion (DAC) chip to be converted to digital signals, hence VGA-HDMI adapters tend to be more costly than DisplayPort-HDMI adapters. Dedicated graphics cards generally support more simultaneous output video streams than integrated graphics cards.</p>
<p>This week, I attempt to untangle the confusion around <strong>USB Type-C</strong>, informally also referred to as USB-C.</p>

It was superseded by HDMI, a video format standardised by consumer electronics companies. DisplayPort, on the other hand, is a video format standardised by computer display companies.</p>
<p>The bulk of the story has been written in <a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s10-issue-123-graphics-cards-the-pixel-factory/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s10-issue-125-analog-and-digital-conversion" target="_blank">Issue 123</a>, so this issue will be short.</p>
<h2>Why two digital formats? HDMI vs DisplayPort</h2>
<p>HDMI is a consumer electronics standard, and is thus heavily focused on broadcast and home video needs. HDMI primarily supports video and audio data. It also carries some control signals through CEC (for Consumer Electronics Control) capability, enabling a video game console or set-top box to send remote-control commands to a television set via the HDMI connection.</p>

The graphics pipeline requires more specialised hardware that can process decimal number calculations. This is why high-performance graphics usually requires a graphics card.</p>
<p>So why are gamers so agog over <strong>graphics cards</strong> (also known as video cards)? That’s because they do one thing really well! Unlike CPUs which often have to process an unpredictable workload, the graphics pipeline involves performing the same categories of calculations over and over again.</p>
<h2>Graphics compute units</h2>
<p>These calculations, which I gave an overview of in <a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/lmg-s10-issue-122-the-great-flattening/?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s10-issue-123-graphics-cards-the-pixel-factory" target="_blank">Issue 122</a>, take in tables of numbers, crunch them mathematically, and spit out another table of numbers. Since the calculations are predictable, we don’t need very complicated hardware that enables switching instructions based on the input. We can used specialised cores—clusters of transistors that are custom-fit for the purpose, cram lots of them into a circuit board, and end up with much better performance for the graphics pipeline compared to the CPU.</p>

Images known as textures can be mapped to faces to give the impression of detail.</p>
<p>Having a model represented in a computer as a large set of numbers is cool, but nobody does 3D modelling like that. We need something to look at! We need a way to convert our model into a flat picture, ideally displayed on our monitors. And this conversion process needs to be fast enough that as we rotate or change the view of our model, the computer can keep up, displaying the changes in real-time.</p>

<p>This issue, let’s start from scratch with graphics: how does a machine that only processes 1s and 0s work with graphics? For starters, let’s think: what can we represent about graphics if we only have numbers?</p>
