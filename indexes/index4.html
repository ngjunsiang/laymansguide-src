                            <p>So far I have been describing things as though only one developer was working on a project. What happens when two developers are involved? Any kind of collaboration between people working on one thing usually leads to issues coordinating their efforts. How do developers manage this?</p>
<p>Usually, by not working on the same part of the code at the same time. But in addition to that, developers have also come up with some good practices and work philosophies to minimise the friction involved in working together.</p>
<p>In this issue, I want to introduce <strong>forking</strong> and , key ideas behind version control systems and how they keep developers sane.</p>

                            <p>Last issue, I introduced <strong>version control</strong>, the idea that you can set things up in a way that lets you see the <strong>change history</strong> of a document. This lets you undo changes which you later come to regret, and compare the document to a previous point in history. If you have a version control system (VCS) set up, you can commit changes to it and view a list of those changes later.</p>
<p>When one is just starting out in software development, one thing that often happens is this. You start writing code for an app-say, a todo list. You write code to set up a database, display a login and other stuff. You commit the changes to the code. You add core features: add/remove/update a todo item; commit. You come up with more ideas: subtasks, recurring items, tags, filters, and all that jazz. Commit, commit, commit. You now have a complete app with bells and whistles, but the code is a sprawling mess: when you finally test the app, there are strange bugs everywhere, the lists don't filter properly, and the database gets messier and messier.</p>
<p>Proper planning can make this more orderly to some extent, but it cannot eliminate one fact of programming: that there will always be bugs. And the only way to catch them is to test the app.</p>

                            <p>Have you ever worked on a large document with a team of people before? If you have, did it go well? Did people get along and not get into conflict with each other over conflicting ideas or changes? If it did, please drop me an email and let me know! In my experience it is so frustrating and I have difficulty seeing how it can be done without some kind of standardised, automated process for keeping everyone updated.</p>
<p>In the past, when documents were still mostly managed manually (before the Internet happened), important documents used to be in a file for everyone to reference. Maybe there were multiple copies for VIPs. Whenever that document got updated, it had to have a <strong>change log</strong> attached to say what had changed and when. You still see this sometimes today, in some reference documents, and in software updates. The idea behind being able to see the <em>history</em> of a document—a record of how it has changed over time—is an idea that has survived and been passed down to each generation of makers. We often refer to such inherited ideas as wisdom, and the modern form of this idea is known as <strong>version control</strong>.</p>

<p>All that is cool, but even with that magical aid, working on some projects can be complicated in <em>different</em> ways. For example, if you are working on a web app (or website), you can end up with folders everywhere, and all kinds of HTML and CSS and javascript files.</p>

<p>A shell script works really well when you just need to do things with folders, and run programs to work on files. But anything more advanced, such as <a href="https://buttondown.email/laymansguide/archive/a6941efd-86bf-4fd8-92c9-009fe14a8c2a?utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-s2-issue-17-libraries" target="_blank">making network requests</a>, quickly gets tricky.

                            <p>So you just got back from a trip with lots of photos in your camera. You take the SD card out from the camera, put it in your laptop, open up the photos … and realise they all have the wrong white balance set.</p>
<p>Or if you’re like me, you spend the better part of an afternoon using your camera to ‘scan’ a textbook for later reference. That means you now have over 300 photos to crop separately (left and right pages), adjust levels (to make the image more like it was done with a scanner), and do other minor corrections.</p>
<p>You know your way around Photoshop (or GIMP), but no way you are going to do that by hand for a week or so—we’ve all got lives to get on with! But you spend half an hour googling, and can’t find any tools that can help you to get the job done quickly. (Okay, there’s XnView, but let’s just pretend that doesn’t exist for the purpose of this issue.)</p>
<p>You have just discovered the need for computerised batch processing.</p>

                            <p>If something’s not working correctly in your operating system, someone has to dig into the settings and configuration, figure out what’s wrong, and resolve the issue. If you have ever been in those shoes, you have been basically doing a sysadmin’s job. (Okay, put away those pitchforks you sysadmin purists and hear me out …)</p>
<p>Every system you have ever interacted with needs to run on a computer, usually hidden away somewhere: point-of-sale systems, advertising screens, email servers, print servers, web servers, … and these systems can start going awry too. Sysadmins, experienced or otherwise, are the ones who fix them. If this system has a screen and a place to plug in a keyboard, fine. But what if it doesn’t?</p>
<p>Before graphical interfaces and the mouse cursor came about, there was a primitive (but no less powerful) interface: the command line.</p>

                            <p>Last season, I used an app I was making to get into the differences between HTTP and HTTPS. It wrapped things up at a point I’m pretty happy with, left some questions unanswered (for now), and got me thinking what to cover next. I’ve thought about how best to cover the remaining topics, and I could well continue in the same thread, going on to say more (relevant and untechnical) things about networking and its technicalities, but from experience it gets dry and dreary very quickly.</p>
<p>One question I get pretty often is: “I’m interested in Computing, but where should I start? What should I do?” The first thing I tell them is not to learn programming, but to understand what developers do, because this is not obvious knowledge. So I’m going to try to build up your picture of computing first, before we get back to networking.</p>
<p>Season 2 is going to be about the work of developers: what they do, a bit of how they do it, and the cool things they get to play with. Yup, there are 13 issues worth of things to talk about!</p>
<p>Let’s start with the obvious: developers write code. They write code that runs all the services you use. The not-so-obvious part: not all code is the same. Just as the same letters can be used in different languages, the same keyboard can type code in different languages. The code serves different purposes.</p>

                            <p>In the last issue, I showed you how I create HTTP requests with custom headers. I put my developer API key in the request header and Hypothes.is gave me a response containing my profile data.</p>
<p>Let’s do a perspective change. Zoom out, out of the computer. Where does my request go? Obviously it has to get out of my computer and get to the server. My laptop’s wifi chip turns the request from an electrical signal into electromagnetic waves, which are broadcasted to the nearest wifi access point, which converts it back to an electrical signal and sends it on its way to the rest of the internet.</p>
<p>Pause that picture for a while. How does my laptop know which access point to send the request to? How does the access point know, from among a bunch of laptops in the vicinity, which laptop to return the response to? (This is becoming quite a disturbing pattern of questioning isn’t it.)</p>
<p> my laptop doesn’t know! Neither does the access point!</p>

                            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> They actually don’t. This is not a snarky answer; it is true! Think about it. When the server receives a request, it has no idea if it’s coming from real-you, or someone pretending to be you. All it knows is your IP address, your user agent, and your request. And all three can actually be spoofed (but we won’t go into detail here).</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> We have a long and complicated system of verifying that the person making the request really owns the account and it is called … the login.</p>
<p>Logins depend on what is known in cryptography as a <strong>shared secret</strong>. A shared secret is a piece information that only you and the server know, and no one else is supposed to know it. If you are able to provide that shared secret, it is probably safe to assume that you are … really you (hopefully?).</p>
<p>When I first access the Hypothes.is API, the Hypothes.is server has no way to know that I am the user whose username is “kureshii”. Even if I declare that I am kureshii, the server has no way to know I really am kureshii—anybody could say that! So when I request a profile, it returns me the default public profile:</p>

                            <p>Last issue, I talked about HTTP response headers, and how they inform the client about the request status using a status code. Let’s talk about the HTTP request today. An HTTP request header looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="An HTTP request header" class="newsletter-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngjunsiang/laymansguide/release/season1/issue009/issue009_01.png"/>
<small>A request header</small></p>
<p>Really simple. In Issue 6, I said that to use an API we need to send a request using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE. You can see the GET method in use here. It’s literally just a word in the request header! Followed by the URL which we are requesting, in his case I’m searching for annotations made by me on Hypothes.is.</p>
<p>The rest of the first line in the request header is my request URL. The full URL I am using is actually <a href="https://hypothes.is/api/search?user=kureshii&amp;utm_source=laymansguide&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lmg-issue-9-how-do-i-make-an-http-request" target="_blank"><code>https://hypothes.is/api/search?user=kureshii</code></a>. Notice that the request header URL does not have the front bit. This request header is already being crafted according to HTTP (which is a protocol, a set of rules) so we don‘t need the https part. “hypothes.is” is known as the host because it is the server <em>host</em>ing the API.</p>

                            <h2>[LMG] Issue 8: HTTP error codes—How does a server let the client know if there’s something wrong with their HTTP request?</h2>
                        </a>
                        <div class="email-teaser email-detail">
                            <p>Last issue, I said that HTTP is a set of rules for sending and receiving documents that link to other documents. According to those rules, if you want a webpage, you (the client) must send a (HTTP) request to a server, which will return a response.</p>
<p>I almost forgot one of my rules here, that it is just as important to know <em>why</em> you should do something as to know how to do it. All I need right now is to craft an HTTP request to get my data from Hypothes.is. In fact, HTTP requests and responses form the backbone of everything we do on the internet. Knowing what I know about them, I want to go a little in depth (just one issue, I promise), so that later some of the things I say about internet security will make a little more sense.</p>
<p>Last thing before the dive: A request or response typically has two parts: a <strong>header</strong> and a <strong>body</strong>. Think of the body as a letter you receive; the header is the envelope that the letter came in. It tells you something about where or who this letter is from, whether it was returned or successfully delivered, maybe even a date stamp.</p>
<h2>What does an HTTP Response header look like?</h2>

<p>Sorry, I didn’t mean to be snarky. But that really is what you do. The question is, “what is a <em>nice</em> request?”</p>
<p>These days, the answer is “a request that follows REST principles”.</p>
<p>Nope, I’m not going to tell you what REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is. It is not something you must know to get around. But there are some things about it you <em>should</em> know:</p>

                            <p><strong>Short version:</strong> An Application Programming Interface (API) is a data browser for apps, a way for apps to talk to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Long version:</strong> Imagine you're an app. You would rather have the data raw, without all the formatting that humans consider vital to their understanding.</p>

                            <p>You would think that the first challenge in writing an app is learning the programming language. In my case, there was an even more fundamental challenge to overcome first: how to get my data.</p>
<p>We don’t think about who actually owns the data you upload onto the internet until it is too late. You access your photos by logging in to Instagram, your tweets by logging in to Twitter, and everything else by logging in to something else. Until one of more of these services break down or you get tired of them and you want out, you would never even think about the fact that you often can’t get all this data out except by manually opening each and everyone one of them and saving them to your disk. But I will need some way to get my data out from Hypothes.is, or my app is not going to happen …</p>
<p>“Well, maybe if I learn programming and figure out a way for an app to load these pages and save them automatically, it could go a lot faster.” It certainly can; this method is called page scraping (more on this possibly in a future issue; but not now). But it means your app will have to deal with HTML data, like this:</p>

<p>The best part? I already have an account, and quite a few highlights in there for use. No need to write the whole annotation system myself! Now I just need to figure out how to get my annotations from there, and put new annotations into the Hypothes.is service.</p>

                            <p>These holidays, I started making an app. It wasn’t a spontaneous decision. I had been thinking about it for years.</p>
<p>It started when I started saving articles from the internet to read in my free time. First on diigo, then Pinboard, then Pocket, then Instapaper, and a few other little experimental apps I’ve forgotten (and which probably aren’t accessible now). I realised, hundreds of articles in, that I didn’t really have a way to revisit what I had read. Worse still, I didn’t even have an easy way to retrieve all the thoughts I had when I read what I read. And I was far from having a consistent way of linking what I read.</p>
<p>The current best services for highlighting and annotating, in my experience, are:
1) Pocket, which was great for reading but didn’t have highlights (back then).
2) Instapaper, which was great for highlighting, but not very good for getting highlights out of the service into anything else.
3) Readmill, which was bought by Dropbox in 2014 and scuttled. This was, arguably, the first social reading app that made an impact. And I had been hoping for someone to recreate the experience.</p>
<p>If your impression of “social reading” brings to mind Facebook, Twitter and other services, you are way off. That already exists, and it is closer to “social sharing”. Facebook and Twitter don’t make it easy to have meaningful conversations around discrete bits of reading which are easily referenced later.</p>
